      "'''anarchism''' is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions. these are often described as stateless societies although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical free associations. anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful.\n",
      "\n",
      "while anti-statism is central anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations including but not limited to the state system.  anarchism is usually considered an extreme left-wing ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics.\n",
      "\n",
      "anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. many types and traditions of anarchism exist not all of which are mutually exclusive. anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "the term ''anarchism'' is a compound word composed from the word ''anarchy'' and the suffix ''-ism'' themselves derived respectively from the greek  i.e. ''anarchy'' (from  ''anarchos'' meaning \"one without rulers\"; from the privative prefix á¼€Î½- (''an-'' i.e. \"without\") and  ''archos'' i.e. \"leader\" \"ruler\"; (cf. ''archon'' or  ''arkhÄ“'' i.e. \"authority\" \"sovereignty\" \"realm\" \"magistracy\")) and the suffix  or  (''-ismos'' ''-isma'' from the verbal infinitive suffix -Î¯Î¶ÎµÎ¹Î½ ''-izein''). the first known use of this word was in 1539. various factions within the french revolution labelled opponents as anarchists (as robespierre did the hÃ©bertists) although few shared many views of later anarchists.  there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling but they did not use the word ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre-joseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. since the 1890s and beginning in france the term ''libertarianism'' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the united states; its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states. on the other hand some use ''libertarianism'' to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only referring to free-market anarchism as ''libertarian anarchism''.\n",

      "\n",
      "the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century bc among the works of taoist philosopher laozi and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan. zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist. zhuangzi wrote \"a petty thief is put in jail. a great brigand becomes a ruler of a nation.\" diogenes of sinope and the cynics and their contemporary zeno of citium the founder of stoicism also introduced similar topics. jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition. georges lechartier wrote that \"the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ andÂ ... the first anarchist society was that of the apostles.\" in early islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil war over the caliphate where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the islamic society.\n",
      "\n",
      "the french renaissance political philosopher Ã©tienne de la boÃ©tie wrote in his most famous work the ''discourse on voluntary servitude'' what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent. the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in england. the term \"anarchist\" first entered the english language in 1642 during the english civil war as a term of abuse used by royalists against their roundhead opponents. by the time of the french revolution some such as the ''enragÃ©s'' began to use the term positively in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power seeing \"revolutionary government\" as oxymoronic. by the turn of the 19th century the english word \"anarchism\" had lost its initial negative connotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment particularly jean-jacques rousseau's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "as part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the french revolution william godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought. godwin was according to peter kropotkin \"the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work\" while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke.\n",
      "\n",
      "william godwin \"the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work\".\n",
      "godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. he argued in ''political justice'' (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "his aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people's 'mental enslavement' the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage. he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. in each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.\n",
      "\n",
      "the french pierre-joseph proudhon is regarded as the first ''self-proclaimed'' anarchist a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work ''what is property?'' published in 1840. it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is \"liberty is the mother not the daughter of order.\" in ''what is property?'' proudhon answers with the famous accusation \"property is theft.\" in this work he opposed the institution of decreed \"property\" (''propriÃ©tÃ©'') where owners have complete rights to \"use and abuse\" their property as they wish. he contrasted this with what he called \"possession\" or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. later however proudhon added that \"property is liberty\" and argued that it was a bulwark against state power. his opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.\n",
      "\n",
      "the anarcho-communist joseph dÃ©jacque was the first person to describe himself as \"libertarian\". unlike pierre-joseph proudhon he argued that \"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature.\" in 1844 in germany the post-hegelian philosopher max stirner published the book ''the ego and its own'' which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism. french anarchists active in the 1848 revolution included anselme bellegarrigue ernest coeurderoy joseph dÃ©jacque and pierre joseph proudhon.\n",

      "anarchist mikhail bakunin opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion and allied himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists.\n",
      "\n",
      "in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848 during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt. in spain ramÃ³n de la sagra established the anarchist journal ''el porvenir'' in la coruÃ±a in 1845 which was inspired by proudhonÂ´s ideas. the catalan politician francesc pi i margall became the principal translator of proudhon's works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in 1873 while being the leader of the democratic republican federal party. according to george woodcock \"these translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of spanish anarchism after 1870 but before that time proudhonian ideas as interpreted by pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's.\" according to the ''encyclopÃ¦dia britannica'' \"during the spanish revolution of 1873 pi y margall attempted to establish a decentralised or \"cantonalist\" political system on proudhonian lines.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "in 1864 the international workingmen's association (sometimes called the \"first international\") united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon blanquists philadelphes english trade unionists socialists and social democrats. due to its links to active workers' movements the international became a significant organisation. karl marx became a leading figure in the international and a member of its general council. proudhon's followers the mutualists opposed marx's state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings. woodcock also reports that the american individualist anarchists lysander spooner and william b. greene had been members of the first international. in 1868 following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom (lpf) russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international (which had decided not to get involved with the lpf). they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivisation of property.\n",
      "\n",
      "at first the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in a more revolutionary socialist direction. subsequently the international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads. mikhail bakunin characterised marx's ideas as centralist and predicted that if a marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against. anarchist historian george woodcock reports that \"the annual congress of the international had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the paris commune and in 1871 the general council called only a special conference in london. one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy while a technical excuse â€“ that they had split away from the fÃ©dÃ©ration romande â€“ was used to avoid inviting bakunin's swiss supporters. thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present and the general council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers.\" in 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york. in response the federalist sections formed their own international at the st. imier congress adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "the paris commune was a government that briefly ruled paris from 18 march (more formally from 28 march) to 28 may 1871. the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the franco-prussian war. anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune. they included louise michel the reclus brothers and eugene varlin (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). as for the reforms initiated by the commune such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realisedÂ ... moreover the commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of proudhon on french radical ideas. indeed the commune's vision of a communal france based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes bakunin's and proudhon's ideas (proudhon like bakunin had argued in favour of the \"implementation of the binding mandate\" in 1848Â ... and for federation of communes). thus both economically and politically the paris commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas. george woodcock states:\n",

      "the anti-authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists seeking to \"replace the privilege and authority of the state\" with the \"free and spontaneous organization of labour.\" in 1886 the federation of organized trades and labor unions (fotlu) of the united states and canada unanimously set 1 may 1886 as the date by which the eight-hour work day would become standard.\n",
      "a sympathetic engraving by walter crane of the executed \"anarchists of chicago\" after the haymarket affair. the haymarket affair is generally considered the most significant event for the origin of international may day observances.\n",
      "in response unions across the united states prepared a general strike in support of the event. on 3 may in chicago a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. the next day 4 may anarchists staged a rally at chicago's haymarket square. a bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer. in the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other. seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. the incident became known as the haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. in 1890 a second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight-hour day was made. the event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the haymarket affair. although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event by the following year the celebration of international workers' day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.\n",

      "in 1907 the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries among which important figures of the anarchist movement including errico malatesta pierre monatte luigi fabbri benoÃ®t broutchoux emma goldman rudolf rocker and christiaan cornelissen. various themes were treated during the congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism. a central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism). malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. he thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.\n",

      "the spanish workers federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain. the most successful was the confederaciÃ³n nacional del trabajo (national confederation of labour: cnt) founded in 1910. before the 1940s the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics attracting 1.58Â million members at one point and playing a major role in the spanish civil war. the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922 with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in europe and latin america. in latin america in particular \"the anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in mexico brazil peru chile and argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the spanish c.n.t. as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. the largest and most militant of these organisations was the federaciÃ³n obrera regional argentinaÂ ... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions.\"\n",

      "some anarchists such as johann most advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because \"we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda.\" scholars such as beverly gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed. however most himself once boasted that \"the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. therefore massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion.\" most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885: ''the science of revolutionary warfare'' a how-to manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in new jersey.\n",
      "\n",
      "by the 1880s people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan \"propaganda of the deed\" to refer to individual bombings regicides and tyrannicides. from 1905 onwards the russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal 'expropriations'.\" illegalism as a practice emerged and within it \"the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (\"propaganda by the deed\") and the anarchist burglars (\"individual reappropriation\") expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society. moreover they were clearly meant to be ''exemplary'' invitations to revolt.\". france's bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.\n",
      "\n",
      "however as soon as 1887 important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in ''le rÃ©voltÃ©'' that \"a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite\". a variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement. the anarcho-syndicalist fernand pelloutier argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without \"the individual dynamiter.\"\n",

      "state repression (including the infamous 1894 french ''lois scÃ©lÃ©rates'') of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played a role in these isolated acts. the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the 1871 paris commune the execution and exile of many ''communards'' to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts.\n",

''free society'' (1895â€“1897 as ''the firebrand''; 1897â€“1904 as ''free society'') was a major anarchist newspaper in the united states at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. the publication advocated free love and women's rights and critiqued \"comstockery\" â€“ censorship of sexual information. also m. e. lazarus was an important american individualist anarchist who promoted free love.\n",
      "\n",
      "in new york city's greenwich village bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. they encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical edna st. vincent millay and the lesbian anarchist margaret anderson were prominent among them. discussion groups organised by the villagers were frequented by emma goldman among others. magnus hirschfeld noted in 1923 that goldman \"has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights and especially for those deprived of their rights. thus it came about that she was the first and only woman indeed the first and only american to take up the defence of homosexual love before the general public.\" in fact before goldman heterosexual anarchist robert reitzel (1849â€“1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his detroit-based german language journal ''der arme teufel'' (english: the poor devil). in argentina anarcha-feminist virginia bolten published the newspaper called '''' (english: the woman's voice) which was published nine times in rosario between 8 january 1896 and 1 january 1897 and was revived briefly in 1901.\n",
      "\n",
      "in europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was emile armand. he proposed the concept of ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. he was also a consistent proponent of polyamory. in germany the stirnerists adolf brand and john henry mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality. mujeres libres was an anarchist women's organisation in spain that aimed to empower working class women. it was founded in 1936 by lucÃ­a sÃ¡nchez saornil mercedes comaposada and amparo poch y gascÃ³n and had approximately 30000 members. the organisation was based on the idea of a \"double struggle\" for women's liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. in order to gain mutual support they created networks of women anarchists. lucÃ­a sÃ¡nchez saornil was a main founder of the spanish anarcha-feminist federation mujeres libres who was open about her lesbianism. she was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to censorship and punishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "more recently the british anarcho-pacifist alex comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual ''the joy of sex''. the issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of french anarcho-hedonist philosopher michel onfray in such works as ''thÃ©orie du corps amoureux : pour une Ã©rotique solaire'' (2000) and ''l'invention du plaisir : fragments cyrÃ©aniques'' (2002).\n",

      "===libertarian education and freethought===\n",
      "\n",
      "francesc ferrer i guÃ rdia catalan anarchist pedagogue and free-thinker for english anarchist william godwin education was \"the main means by which change would be achieved.\" godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness. for godwin education had to have \"a respect for the child's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion\" \"a pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child's own motivation and initiatives\" and \"a concern about the child's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school.\" in his ''political justice'' he criticises state sponsored schooling \"on account of its obvious alliance with national government\". early american anarchist josiah warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established. max stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called ''the false principle of our education''. in it stirner names his educational principle \"personalist\" explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. education for him is to create \"free men sovereign characters\" by which he means \"eternal charactersÂ ... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment\".\n",
      "\n",
      "in the united states \"freethought was a basically anti-christian anti-clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. a number of contributors to ''liberty'' (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. the individualist anarchist george macdonald was a co-editor of ''freethought'' and for a time ''the truth seeker''. e.c. walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal ''lucifer the light-bearer''\". \"many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''lucifer the light-bearer'' ''freethought'' and ''the truth seeker'' appeared in ''liberty''...Â the church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself\".\n",
      "\n",
      "in 1901 catalan anarchist and free-thinker francesc ferrer i guÃ rdia established \"modern\" or progressive schools in barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the catholic church. the schools' stated goal was to \"educate the working class in a rational secular and non-coercive setting\". fiercely anti-clerical ferrer believed in \"freedom in education\" education free from the authority of church and state. murray bookchin wrote: \"this period 1890s was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where anarchists exercised some degree of influence. perhaps the best-known effort in this field was francisco ferrer's modern school (escuela moderna) a project which exercised a considerable influence on catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally.\" la escuela moderna and ferrer's ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of ''modern schools'' in the united states cuba south america and london. the first of these was started in new york city in 1911. it also inspired the italian newspaper ''universitÃ  popolare'' founded in 1901. russian christian anarchist leo tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate. tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the tsarist secret police. tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture. he thought that \"education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himselfÂ ... education is culture under restraint culture is free. education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary\". for him \"without compulsion education was transformed into culture\".\n",
      "\n",
      "a more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. experiments in germany led to a. s. neill founding what became summerhill school in 1921. summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice. however although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach.\n",
      "in addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. the term deschooling was popularised by ivan illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.\n",
